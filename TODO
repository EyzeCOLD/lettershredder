Puzzle Mode:
	* Create more levels (atleast 20)
    * World system, to divide levels into worlds
	* Save player progress, so you don't have to restart
	* Custom puzzles from files, could be multiple puzzles per file

Endless Mode:
	* Implement the whole thing
	* Figure out a way to generate a lot of words, maybe build some sort of data
	based on the actual wordlist?
	* There needs to be a way to set the seed so two players can compete with
	the same seed.
	* Highscore rankings

	+ Ideas:
		- Lose condition: run out of time, longer words and multiples give more 
		time relief.
		- Some sort of mechanic to replace undo from Puzzle Mode to help you
		manage variance

			> Break lines for no points to clear a way for new words?
			> Shuffle the board?

		- It's all about highscore then, have to figure out some sort of point
		system that awards you for longer words and multiples. Maybe there's
		a combo multiplier for speed. Like a timer starts winding down after
		you find a word and if you hit another one inside that window you
		get megapoints.

Shootout Mode:
	* Random words from the dictionary are dropped into the frame and you have
	to clear them fast. The idea would be mostly about typing fast, not about
	finding jumbled words from the grid. So every word could just be spelled
	left to right. Lose condition: a letter block that's on solid ground touches
	the top?
	* Honestly this requires a lot of prototyping.
	* Highscore!

Misc:
	* Figure out if Renderer could be made to work without the wide char ncurses
	* Make loading levels do less copying
	* Track deltaTime with a member variable instead of a static
